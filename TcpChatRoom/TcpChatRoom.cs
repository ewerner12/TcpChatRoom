//TCP Chat Room Project
//Users can chat with one another over the local network.

//There should be two projects: one client-side (Client), one server-side (Server). []
//Implement the Observer design pattern to send out a notification to all users 
//  that a new person has joined the chat room. []
//Implement Dependency Injection for logging (log all messages, 
//  log when someone joins the chat, log when someone leaves the chat). []
//Use a Dictionary to store users. []
//Use a Queue to store/process incoming messages. []
//HINT: Use TCPclient instead of raw Socket class. []

//Bonus (5 points): allow direct messages. []

//Bonus(5 points): allow creation of private chat rooms. []

//Super Bonus(5 points): implement a GUI. []
